Mechanical Pizzica, an installation made by me and <a href="http://samuelmellosite.wixsite.com/samuelmello">Samuel</a> for the <a href="http://www.ff3300.com/kastrignana/about.php">Kastrignana</a> exhibition, ideated and realized during the XYLab workshop.<br>

It has been really fun to design and realize this mechanical drum machine, we went far out of our comfort zone. It also makes you feel like a futurist when you play it!<br>

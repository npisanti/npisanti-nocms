Got to make processing work on the rPi, really just to discovery that it’s so slow to be unusable. openFrameworks runs fine directly from the command line if you follow the step to step guide on the site. It’s just strange that it din’t worked on piBang.. i had to switch to standard Raspbian, i think is the same if you don’t startx (but i still have to check).

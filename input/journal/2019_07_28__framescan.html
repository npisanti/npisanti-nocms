<br>
just coded a tool for importing all my doodles frame by frame by using webcam<br>
<br>
maybe it's too raw to be called "animation", but i like that the movement of the frames comes out of imperfection, if i would be able to perfectly draw the same thing over and over and to import it without error the result would have been still and lifeless
<br>
<br>
if you want to build it yourself, the code is in my <a href="https://github.com/npisanti/np-utilities" target="_blank">utilities</a>

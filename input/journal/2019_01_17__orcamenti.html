I'm having lots of fun with Hundred Rabbits' <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/orca">ORCÎ›</a> lately. It's a live coding environment to create and manipulate musical patterns, you can use it to control other software or synthesizer via MIDI or OSC (i'm using it to control my FM synths coded with <a href="https://github.com/npisanti/ofxPDSP">ofxPDSP</a>).<br>

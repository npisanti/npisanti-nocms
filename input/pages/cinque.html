Generative music system running on a raspberry pi controlling some micro televisions by powering them on/off with relays. <br><br>
Both the noise of the televisions and the clicks of the relays were used as musical and visual element, together with some synthesized sound amplified by a cheap speaker. The composition used both probabilistic beats and markov-chains generated melodies, each cycle lasting about 7 minutes.<br>
<br>
The system also controlled two light bulbs in the room, which was set up as an <a href="http://antoniopipolo.com/portfolio/acme/" target="_blank">ACME lab</a>, during Here&#xB3;, an exhibition in the <a href="https://www.cavallerizzairreale.org/" target="_blank">Cavallerizza Irreale</a> (Turin, Italy).<br>

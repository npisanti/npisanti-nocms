The Pizzica is a traditional dance of the Salento, one of the southern territories of Italy. Due to the rising popularity of folk music in extra-Salentinian regions the pizzica is starting to become less authentic and more an object of consumptions. <br>
<br>
Acknowledging this topic, during the <a href="http://xylab.org/" target="_blank">XYLab</a> spawned the idea of an installation to rappresent the mechanization of the Pizzica.<br>
<br>
The work was designed and builded by me and <a href="http://samuelmellosite.wixsite.com/samuelmello" target="_blank">Samuel Mele</a> during the second week of the workshop, with some help from other participants and a local woodworker.  As there was no time to get the materials to realize a solenoid-based actuator we had to make it just with direct motion, so we decided to recycle an old bike instead of using electrical motors at all.  The installation was showcased at the <a href="http://www.kastrignana.org/" target="_blank">Kastrignana </a>exhibition.<br>

Outpost is an installation i made for a workshop with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lucapozziartist" target="_blank">Luca Pozzi</a> at the Toolkit Festival. Four squares of random dimension are shot 60 times per second on the surface of a taped bottle,  reminescent of an outpost or a tower. As our eyes are not so fast in deleting light we always see much more squares than four, so the projection becomes a metaphor for quantum probability. Half of the figures are projected on tape, but the other half also pass through the glass and hit the internal part of the tape, connecting the tape surfaces together in an abstract dimension.<br>

Hi, i'm Nicola Pisanti. <br>
As i worked a lot as a freelance creative coder in the past years i thought this non-conventional resume would fit me better.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm fairly experienced in those tools:
<ul>
<li>c++</li>
<li>linux (both desktop and embedded)</li>
<li>GLSL shaders<O/li>
<li>lua scripting and binding</li>
</ul>
I speak english and italian.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some highlights from my past works to show my skills:<br>
<br>
<br>
In 2015 i released Hexaglyphics, an esoteric noise generator for iPad, built with the JUCE c++ framework:<br>

Since 2016 i maintain ofxPDSP, an openFrameworks addon to make generative music and audio synthesis by writing c++ code.<br> 
It features an API based on lambda functions for generative sequencing and >> operator for patching audio modules. It works on both Linux (x86/ARM), Windows, OSX, Android and iOS.<br> 
Here is an installation built using ofxPDSP running on rPi 3:<br>

you can find more examples <a href="http://npisanti.com/ofxpdsp_page.html" target="_blank">here</a> and the code <a href="https://github.com/npisanti/ofxPDSP" target="_blank">here</a>. The code needs some cleaning but i've learned a lot from my own and other user experience with the framework.

During a residency for creating a dance piece in the EinTanzHaus (Mannheim), in less than three weeks of experimentation i crafted a device able to track the position of 7 dancers in an 8x8 meter space by using openCV. The device was running on a raspberry pi 3 with a 160 degree infrared camera and sending message to a client running on desktop that parsed and encapsulated all the data in a easy to use c++ class. You can find the code and hardware notes for client and server (and other similar tools) <a href="https://github.com/npisanti/ofxClayblocks" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>

Lately i am really into livecoding stuff, so i built some binding to make my own little generative graphics sandbox in lua (oF/luaJIT). I'm also working on a command line utility that let me take different lua scripts, video, picture, GLSL shaders as arguments and mix them to the same window output ( shaders take last rendered state as texture uniform for processing ), you can find the WIP <a href="https://github.com/npisanti/np-miscela" target="_blank">here</a><br>
